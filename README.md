# Finaloop Landing Page

## Goals

The main goal was to showcase the structure that I imagine for a mid to large app with multiple pages relying in one design system and also the ability to translate figma designs into code. For some of them, I took the freedom to showcase other skills on how I think about the creation and structure of components.

## Stack

- Nextjs
- Typescript
- Tailwindcss (tailwind-intersect, tailwind-animated, shadcn)
- react-swiper, react-fast-marquee, next-hubspot
- Storybook
- Vitest

## Performance

Performance is very important, especially when dealing with landing pages that could go in many tools and analytics like Google's analytics and ads, etc.
Here's the page report:

Some improvements can be seeing as how we deal and import 3p scripts.

All images are minified using the [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) website

## Possible improvements

Some quick improvements are:

- Linting: Quick and easy, I just ignore it for now for the sake of speed.
- Animations: Could be better enhanced for user interaction.
- Better parse of 3p scripts.

## Time

The total time took me around 8 hours to complete which included setting the project and thinking about the structure that in common day work would take me half of day to develop.

## Conclusion

I love this kind of project because it allows us, especially frontenders to showcase not only code skills but how we think about the entire app, the design team concerns, SEO and user goals, think that I have a lot of familiarity due to my background in advertising agencies.

Hope you guys enjoy this project and feel free to provide some extra feedback. I would love to hear.
